				1948: The first computer able to store programs was built by Tom Kilburn and designed by Frederic Williams at the University of Manchester, England. It was named the SSEM or Small-Scale Experimental Machine and the first electronically-stored program was executed on June 21 within the same year.

				1953: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/" target="_blank">IBM</a> released its first commercial computer, the so called 701. It was produced and sold 19701 times, hence it being the first mass produced computer.

				1975: The first so called portable computer was the IBM 5100, which was released in September of 1975. It had a 5 inch display, weighed a total of 55 pounds (24.9 Kg), included a PALM CPU clocked at 1.9 MHz and had 64 KB of RAM.
